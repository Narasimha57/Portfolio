            <p className='text-gray-600 font-semibold md:font-semibold mb-6 whitespace-normal truncate text-justify font-sans text-lg mt-0'>I recently completed my Bachelorâ€™s degree in Computer Engineering, specializing in Software Engineering, from Balaji Institute of Technology and Science, Warangal, with an aggregate CGPA of 7.52. Prior to that, I earned a Diploma in Mining Engineering from Daripally Anantha Ramulu College of Engineering and Technology Khammam, after completing my secondary education at ZPP Secondary School. During my academic journey, I developed a strong passion for software development, which culminated in my final-year project titled "College Bus Live Tracking System." This project enhanced my skills in real-time tracking, API integrations, and user interface logic, laying a solid foundation for full-stack development. I have a strong command of Python and Java, along with a understanding of Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) and the Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC). I specialize in MERN Stack Developer with hands-on experience in MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, and Node.js, enabling me to build scalable, responsive, and dynamic full-stack web applications. In addition to coding, I spend time gaming, which helps sharpen my strategic thinking and problem-solving skills. I am now eager to apply my knowledge and passion to real-world software projects and contribute meaningfully to innovative developments in the tech industry.
